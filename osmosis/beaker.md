### [Beaker docs](https://docs.osmosis.zone/developing/dapps/get_started/cosmwasm-testnet.html) 

### [Beaker github](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/beaker) 

Beaker is a tool to interact with Osmosis smart contracts

One really cool feature of Beaker is that you can generate a template dapp with a single command. This template even comes with a front end!
